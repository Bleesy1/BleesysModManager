Read this before getting the program or if you have a problem with it

-The app is not a virus. If it shows a windows smartscreen pop-up, that is because the app is new and is not signed.

-Put in your gamepath in the gamepath textbox, it does not need to have "/BepInEx/Plugins" at the end of it.
oh yeah and by the way it saves it so you do not have to put it in everytime

-all of the mods are legal/not cheats (whatever you want to call allowed mods lmao)

-The utilla is made by graze

-Do not expect this app to be amazing, this is my first time using winforms to make something.

Thanks for using my app:)
